# go-vies
## Python library for VIES (European VAT validation service)

- based on django-vies module https://github.com/codingjoe/django-vies but without Djan(go-) dependency
- compared to django-vies: in single file, provides only the call of the service (returns validity and company info)

- still requires these modules installed: retrying (easy action retry), suds (soap client)
- django imports were replaced:
```python
from django.utils.functional import cached_property
```
<sup>_has no dependency, so was pasted to here from django source_</sup>
```python
from django.utils.translation import ugettext
```
<sup>_in VATIN._validate(), replaced with 1:1 "translation" MSG_TRANSLATE - can be customized_</sup>

It is good idea to update VIES_OPTIONS from current version of django-vies/vies/__init__.py.

### Usage:
```python
import go_vies
go_vies.MSG_TRANSLATE = catalog.ugettext
            # optional, your translation function to translate english messages to current locale
            # this is really not important to set (used for 2 raised ValueError messages only)
vatin = go_vies.VATIN('CZ', '26428091')
vatin.is_valid()
True
vatin.result
(reply){
   countryCode = "CZ"
   vatNumber = "26428091"
   requestDate = 2015-12-07
   valid = True
   name = "e-FRACTAL, s.r.o."
   address = "Vinohradsk√° 1597/174
PRAHA 3 - VINOHRADY
130 00  PRAHA 3"
 }
vatin.result['name']
e-FRACTAL, s.r.o.
```
